# Biological-Computation-Final-Project
This project develops a program to identify 18 monotonic Boolean functions related to gene regulation. It generates all possible Boolean functions based on activator and repressor states, then filters them to ensure monotonicity. The program confirms the functions' adherence to biological constraints and outputs the valid ones.
